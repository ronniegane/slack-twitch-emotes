# Twitch Emotes for Slack
Is your slack channel boring and lifeless? Having trouble getting your real emotions across with the standard emojis?
Now you can upload all current Twitch and BTTV emotes to your Slack workspace so you can LUL at the good times, pepehands at the bad times, and kappa all the time.

Largely inspired by the Ruby app [caldrealabs/kappa-slack](https://github.com/calderalabs/kappa-slack).
